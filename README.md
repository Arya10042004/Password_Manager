# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
To assist users in efficiently handling their credentials, the password management system focuses on three core functionalities:

Core Functionalities

1. Store:

The application allows users to securely save multiple site credentials, including site names, usernames, and passwords, all in one centralized location. By offering a dedicated platform, it eliminates the hassle of remembering or storing credentials in unsecured formats such as notebooks or plain text files. Each entry is uniquely identifiable, ensuring seamless organization and retrieval.

2. Manage:

Managing credentials is effortless with intuitive features such as:
•	Edit: Update credentials to reflect changes, such as a new password or updated username, without creating a new entry.
•	Delete: Remove outdated or redundant entries with a single click, ensuring the stored data remains relevant and clutter-free.
•	Update: Modify any aspect of a credential entry, allowing users to adapt their stored information as needed.

3. Access:

The system prioritizes quick and convenient access to stored credentials. Users can efficiently search and retrieve specific entries and leverage the "Copy to Clipboard" feature to copy passwords or usernames instantly. This functionality minimizes the risk of errors associated with manual typing and streamlines access to accounts across various platforms.


Key Technologies Used

React.js:

The project is built using React.js, a powerful JavaScript library designed for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for efficient development, as reusable components handle various aspects of the application, such as credential lists, input forms, and interactive buttons. Its state management ensures real-time updates, enabling smooth interactions like editing, deletion, or copying credentials.






Tailwind CSS:

Styling the application is streamlined with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind offers pre-designed classes, ensuring consistency in design while saving development time. Its responsive design capabilities ensure the application looks and functions flawlessly across devices, enhancing the user experience for both desktop and mobile users.

Local Storage:

Local storage is used to persistently store user credentials directly in the browser. This approach eliminates the need for an external database, making the application lightweight and independent of server-side operations. Data remains available even after the application is closed, and the unique ID assigned to each entry facilitates seamless operations like deletion, editing, and retrieval. Local storage ensures that users maintain complete control over their data while benefiting from offline accessibility.
